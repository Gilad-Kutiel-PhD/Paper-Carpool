\section{\ca{}}
In this section, we consider the \ca{} problem.
As in Section~\ref{sec:uca}, we show an efficient, optimal solution for trees.
We then present an k-approximation algorithm, where $k$ is the maximum capacity
of a vertex in the graph.
We show that our analysis of the approximation algorithm is tight.
