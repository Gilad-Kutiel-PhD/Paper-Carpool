Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
a weight function on the edges $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
a capacity function on the vertices $c: V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, 
a feasible \emph{carpool assignment} is a subset of $E$ such that:
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the in-degree of every vertex does not exceed its capacity
\item the out degree of every vertex is at most $1$, and
\item for every vertex $v \in V$ either the out-degree or the in-degree is $0$.
\end{inparaenum}
 
In the \emph{Carpool Assignment} problem we seek for a feasible assignment
$S$ that maximize the total weight on the edges, 
i.e. $max_{S : \text{S is feasible}} \sum_{e \in S}{w(e)}$.
The \uca{} problem is the special case,
when $c(v) = \infty$ for every vertex $v \in V$.
The \uca{} is known to be NP-hard even for a
binary weight function.

In this paper we present an efficient, optimal solution for the problem when the
given graph is a tree. 
We then present a 2-approximation algorithm for general graphs.
