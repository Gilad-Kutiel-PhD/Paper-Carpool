Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
a weight function $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$, 
and a spanning tree $T = (V, E')$ of the underlying graph, 
we refer to the directed acyclic graph resulting from directing the edges 
of $T$ according to their original direction as the \emph{spanning layered graph}
of $G$.
For a given spanning layered graph $L = (V, E')$, denote by $L_i$ the $i$th
layer, where $L_0$ is the set of vertices in $L$ with in degree equal to zero,
and $L_i$, for $i > 0$, is the set of vertices with a minimum distance of $i$ from $L_0$.
Denote by $l(v)$ the layer of vertex $v$ and let 
$$ E'_{even} = \{ (u, v) : l(u) \equiv 0 \mod 2 \} $$
and    
$$ E'_{odd} = \{ (u, v) : l(u) \equiv 1 \mod 2 \} $$

For a set of edges $E$ let $w(E) = \sum_{e \in E}{w(e)}$, 
then, it is easy to verify that the following properties hold:

\begin{observation}
The sets $E'_{even}$, and $E'_{odd}$ form a partition of $E$. 
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}
\label{ob:geq_half}
$ \max(w(E'_{even}), w(E'_{odd}))  \geq \frac{w(E)}{2} $
\end{observation}
