We study the weighted and unweighted variants of the \CARPOOL{} problem and present
a min-cost flow based 3-approximation, 
and a local search based 2-approximation algorithms for the two variants of the
problem respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, 
these are the first approximation algorithms to the problem.
