\label{apx:k-local}
In this section we consider a natural generalization of the LocalSearch 
algorithm, presented in Section~\ref{sub:uwcm}.
The k-local search algorithm maintains a feasible matching $M$ through its execution.
In every step,
the algorithm tries to increase the size of $M$, 
by choosing $k$ vertices, permute their role,
and then compute an optimal, fixed matching.
The algorithm terminates when no further improvement can be done.
We describe the k-local search algorithm in Algorithm~\ref{alg:k-local}, 
using the following notations: 
For a given set $V$, let $V^k = \{V' \subseteq V \mid |V'| = k\}$, 
and for a given set $K$ let $2^K = \{(P, D) \mid \text{P and D form a partition of K}\}$. 


\begin{algorithm}
\SetKw{True}{true}
\SetKw{False}{false}
\KwIn{$G = (V, E)$, $c : V \rightarrow \N$}
\KwOut{$M$}
$M \leftarrow \emptyset$					\\
\Repeat{done}{
\label{line:outerloop}
	$done$ \leftarrow{} \True			\\
	\For{$K \in V^k$}{
		\For{$(P, D) \in 2^K$}{
			$D' \leftarrow D^M_u \setminus K \cup D$	 	\\
			$M' = \text{opt}_{fixed}(V \setminus D', D')$	\\
			\If{$|M'| > |M|$}{
				$M \leftarrow M'$							\\
				$done$ \leftarrow{} \False					\\
			}
		}
	}
}
\Return{$M$}

Clearly, this is a generalization of the LocalSearch algorithm, thus, 
by Theorem~\ref{th:ls-2}, it achieves approximation ratio of 2.
To see that the k-local search algorithm does not achieves a better approximation ratio than 2, 
consider the graph given in Figure~\ref{fig:k-local-tight},
assuming a uniform weight function,  
and no capacity constraints.

Let the black edges, in the example, 
denote a possible solution of the k-local search algorithm, 
and the red, dashed, edges, denote the optimal solution.
Note that the ratio between the optimal and the k-local search solutions is 
$\frac{2(n-1)}{n}$, and it tends to $2$ when $n$ is large.
Note, also, 
that no improvement can be done by permuting the role of any $k$ vertices (for any fixed $k$).
