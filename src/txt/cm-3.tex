We now present a 3-app\-roximation algorithm for the \textsc{\CARPOOL{}} problem.
This algorithm acts in two phases.
In the first phase it computes a subgraph of $G$ 
where $d_{in}(v) \leq c(v)$, and $d_{out}(v) \leq 1$ for every $v \in V$, 
then, in the second phase it turns this subgraph to a feasible matching
by removing some of the edges.

Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
a weight function $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$, 
and a spanning tree $T$ of the underlying graph, 
we refer to the directed bipartite
\footnote{a graph whose underlying graph is a tree, must be a bipartite graph}
graph resulting from directing the edges 
of $T$ according to their original direction
\footnote{if there are antisymmetric edges in $G$, 
choose an arbitrary direction to the underlying edge}
as the \emph{spanning bipartite graph} of $G$.
An example of a spanning bipartite graph is illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:spanning-bipartite-graph}

and $E_{RL}$ is the red, dotted edge   
}
\end{figure}

For a given spanning bipartite graph $G = (V = (L, R), E)$, 
denote by $E_{LR}$ the edges directed from a vertex in $L$ to a vertex in $R$,
and by $E_{RL}$ the edges directed from a vertex in $R$ to a vertex in $L$,
For a set of edges $E$ let $w(E) = \sum_{e \in E}{w(e)}$, 
then, clearly, the following property holds:

\begin{observation}
\label{ob:geq_half}
$ \max\{w(E_{LR}), w(E_{RL})\}  \geq \frac{w(E)}{2} $
\end{observation}


We now describe our algorithm. 
Assume for a moment, 
that every vertex can acts both as a driver and as passenger.
We refer to a matching, under this assumption, as a \emph{super matching}.
We now show how an optimal super matching can be found efficiently.
Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
a weight function $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
and a capacity function $c : V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, 
when every vertex can acts both as a driver and as a passenger, 
a \emph{super matching} is a subgraph of $G$, 
where $d_{in}(v) \leq c(v)$, and $d_{out}(v) \leq 1$ for every $v \in V$. 
A maximum super matching can be found by the following reduction 
to a maximum weight flow problem: 
Let $N = (G', s, t, c', w')$ be a flow network, where 
\begin{align*}
G'				& = (V_p \cup V_d \cup \{s, t\}, E_{sp} \cup E_{pd} \cup E_{dt})	\\
V_p				& = \{v_p : v \in V\} \\
V_d				& = \{v_d : v \in V\} \\
E_{sp}			& = \{ (s, u_p) : u_p \in V_p \} \\
E_{pd}			& = \{ ((u_p, v_d)) : (u, v) \in E \} \\
E_{dt}			& = \{ (v_d, t) : v_d \in V_d \} \\
c'(u, v)		& =
\begin{cases}
c(u) & \text{if } (u, v) \in E_{dt} \\
1 & \text{otherwise}	
\end{cases}
\\
w'(u_d, v_p)	& = 
\begin{cases}
w(u, v) & \text{if } (u_d, v_p) \in E_{pd} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}	
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

That is, 
we construct a bipartite graph where the left side represent each vertex 
in $V$ being a passenger,
and the right side each vertex in $V$ being a driver.
Figure~\ref{fig:cm-flow} illustrates this flow network.
%
\begin{figure}
\input{txt/fig-cm-flow}
\caption{
\label{fig:cm-flow}
Illustration of the flow network that is used to find a super-matching.
}
\end{figure}
%
One can verify that this is indeed a flow network and that there is a straight forward 
translation between a flow and a super matching with the same weight.

We now consider the underlying graph of an optimal super matching.
Recall that in a super matching the out degree of every vertex is at most 1,
that is, the underlying graph of a super matching is a set of connected components,
where, the number of edges, 
in every connected component is at most the number of vertices in that component.

We now show how to transform a super matching into a feasible matching.
We can, without loss of generality, 
consider a single connected component in the underline graph of a maximum super matching.
Given a connected component $C = (V, E)$ we construct a feasible matching by
computing a maximum spanning bipartite graph $L = (V, E'_{even}, E'_{odd})$ of $C$,
and returning the set of edges in the odd layers or the even layers,
whichever has a higher weight. 
We describe the algorithm in Algorithm~\ref{alg:cm3}.

\begin{algorithm}
\label{alg:cm3}
\KwIn{$G = (V, E), c : V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}, w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$}											 
\KwOut{$(M \subseteq E)$}

$M \leftarrow \emptyset$								\\
$G' \leftarrow \text{superMatching($G$)}$				\\

\For{every connected component $C_i = (V^i, E^i) \in G'$}{	
	$(V^i, E' = (E'_{LR}, E'_{RL})) \leftarrow \text{maximum spanning bipartite graph of } C_i$
	\\
	$M \leftarrow M \cup \argmax_{F \in \{ E'_{LR}, E'_{RL} \}}{w(F)}$	
}

\Return $M$
\caption{Super Matching Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

We now show that the Super Matching is 3-approximation algorithm.
Once again, we limit, without loss of generality, 
our analysis to a single connected component.
Let $(V, E)$ be the underlying graph of the super matching, 
and let $M^*$ be an optimal matching, then:
\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:super-geq-m^*}
$w(E) \geq w(M^*)$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Obviously, every matching is a valid super-matching, 
and $w(E)$ is the weight of an optimal super-matching 
\end{proof}

Let
$$ M = \argmax_{F \in \{ E'_{LR}, E'_{RL} \}}{w(F)} $$
be the matching computed by Algorithm~\ref{alg:cm3}, then:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:more_than_e}
$w(M) \geq w(E) - w(E')$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $E = E' \cup \{e\}$, and that $e$ is the lightest edge on some cycle in $(V, E)$ 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:cm3} achieves a 3-approximation ratio.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
From Observation~\ref{ob:geq_half}, Lemma~\ref{lm:super-geq-m^*},
and Lemma~\ref{lm:more_than_e} we get that
$$ 3w(M) = 2w(M) + w(M) \geq w(E') + w(E) - w(E') = w(E) \geq w(M^*)$$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}

\input{txt/fig-3cm-tight}

\label{fig:3cm-tight-fig}
Super Matching Algorithm, worst case example
}
\end{figure}

To see that our analysis is tight, consider the example in Figure~\ref{fig:3cm-tight-fig},
assume, for the given graph in the figure, 
that all weights are 1 and that there is no capacity constraint.
The maximum matching, then, is 3 ($\{(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)\}$), 
but the algorithm can return the super matching $\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)\}$ from which, 
only one edge can survive.
