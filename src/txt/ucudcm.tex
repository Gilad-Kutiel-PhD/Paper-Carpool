\label{sub:ucudcm}
In this section we consider the uncapacitated variant of the problem. 
We give a simple 2-approximation algorithm for this variant, 
and give an example to show that our analysis is tight.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph, 
and let $T = (V, E')$ be a maximum spanning tree of the underlying graph of $G$.
Let $\overrightarrow{T}$ be the directed graph, 
obtained by directing the edges in $T$ according to their original direction
($\text{direct}(T)$).
As we remarked in the preliminaries, 
$\overrightarrow{T}$ is a bipartite graph, 
and we can write $\overrightarrow{T} = (V, E_{LR} \cup E_{RL})$. 

We can now describe our algorithm in Algorithm~\ref{alg:apx}.

\begin{algorithm}
\label{alg:apx}
\caption{MaxTree}
$T = (V, E') \leftarrow$ maximum spanning tree of $G$	\\
$(V, E_{LR}, E_{RL}) \leftarrow$ direct$(T)$			\\
Return $\argmax_{F \in \{ E_{LR}, E_{RL} \}}{w(F)} $	\\
\end{algorithm}

We now prove that the approximation ratio of MaxTree is 2.
We start with a simple lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lm:tree_upper_matching}
The weight of a maximum spanning tree of $G$ is an upper bound on the weight of
an optimal matching in $G$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the underlying graph of an optimal matching, 
and complete it to a spanning tree, obviously, the
weight of the resulted tree is no more than the weight of a maximum spanning
tree.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The MaxTree algorithm achieves approximation ratio of 2.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows directly from 
Lemma~\ref{lm:tree_upper_matching} and Observation~\ref{ob:bipartition}.
\end{proof}

To see that the analysis is tight, 
consider a uniform weighted clique with $n$ vertices, 
and a spanning path, 
then the approximation algorithm selects $\frac{n - 1}{2}$ edges, 
while there are $n - 1$ in an optimal solution.
