Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
a weight function $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$, 
and a spanning tree $T$ of the underlying graph, 
we refer to the directed acyclic graph resulting from directing the edges 
of $T$ according to their original direction
\footnote{if there are antisymmetric edges in $G$, 
choose an arbitrary direction to the underlying edge}
as the \emph{spanning bipartite graph}
of $G$.

For a given spanning bipartite graph $G = (V = (L, R), E)$, 
denote by $E_{LR}$ the edges directed from a vertex in $L$ to a vertex in $R$,
and by $E_{RL}$ the edges directed from a vertex in $R$ to a vertex in $L$,
For a set of edges $E$ let $w(E) = \sum_{e \in E}{w(e)}$, 
then, it is easy to verify that the following properties hold:

\begin{observation}
The sets $E_{LR}$ and $E'_{RL}$ form a partition of $E$. 
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}
\label{ob:geq_half}
$ \max(w(E_{LR}), w(E_{RL}))  \geq \frac{w(E)}{2} $
\end{observation}

The idea of the spanning bipartite graph is illustrated in
