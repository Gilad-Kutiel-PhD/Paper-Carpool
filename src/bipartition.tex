\label{sec:bipartition}
Given a directed bipartite graph $G = (L\cup R, E)$, 
let $E_{LR} = E \cap (L \times R)$, 
and let $E_{RL} = E \cap (R \times L)$.
Clearly $E_{LR} \cup E_{RL} = E$, moreover, 
if a weight function $w:E \rightarrow \R$ 
assigns weight to every edge in $G$ then the following observation holds:
\begin{observation}
\label{ob:bipartition}
$\max(w(E_{LR}), w(E_{LR})) \geq \frac{w(E)}{2}$
\end{observation}

In particular, given a directed graph $G$, 
and a maximum spanning tree $T$ of $G$, 
directing the edges in $T$ according to their original direction result 
with a directed bipartite graph $\T$.
We refer to $\T$ as the \emph{maximum spanning bipartite graph}
of $G$.
